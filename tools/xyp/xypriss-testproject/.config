/**
 * XyPriss Project Dependencies Configuration File
 *
 * This file defines the dependencies required for a TypeScript XyPriss project template.
 * It is used by the XyPCLI tool during project initialization to automatically install
 * all necessary packages via npm.
 *
 * The file is structured in two main sections:
 * - Deps: Regular dependencies that are required for the project to run
 * - DevDeps: Development dependencies used for building, testing, and development
 *
 * Each dependency is listed without version numbers to allow npm to install the latest
 * compatible versions. The CLI will execute 'npm install {dep}' for regular deps and
 * 'npm install --save-dev {dep}' for dev dependencies.
 *
 * This approach ensures that new projects start with up-to-date packages while maintaining
 * compatibility with the XyPriss framework ecosystem.
