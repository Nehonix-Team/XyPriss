# XyPrissSecurity Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive tests for the XyPrissSecurity library, organized into dedicated test files for better maintainability and reference.

## Test Files

### 1. `server-creation.test.ts`

Tests basic server creation and core functionality:

-   ✅ Server instance creation
-   ✅ Immediate middleware API availability
-   ✅ Basic route handling (GET, POST)
-   ✅ Middleware registration and execution
-   ✅ Method chaining support

### 2. `rate-limiting.test.ts`

Tests rate limiting functionality:

-   ✅ Basic rate limiting with custom limits
-   ✅ Rate limit window reset behavior
-   ✅ Disabled rate limiting
-   ✅ Per-IP rate limiting (different buckets)

### 3. `cors.test.ts`

Tests Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):

-   ✅ Basic CORS configuration
-   ✅ Origin filtering (allow/deny)
-   ✅ Method and header restrictions
-   ✅ Disabled CORS behavior
-   ✅ Preflight request handling

### 4. `security.test.ts`

Tests security middleware functionality:

-   ✅ Basic security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection)
-   ✅ Security configuration through middleware API
-   ✅ Disabled security behavior
-   ✅ Security headers persistence across routes
-   ✅ Security combined with other middleware

### 5. `integration.test.ts`

Tests multiple features working together:

-   ✅ Full stack API with all middleware enabled
-   ✅ Rate limiting combined with CORS
-   ✅ Error handling with middleware
-   ✅ Performance with multiple middleware layers

### 6. `run-all-tests.ts`

Main test runner that executes all test suites:

-   🏃 Runs all tests sequentially
-   📊 Provides comprehensive test report
-   ⏱️ Measures execution time
-   📈 Calculates success rate

## Running Tests

### Run Individual Test Files

```bash
# Server creation tests
npx tsx src/__tests__/server-creation.test.ts

# Rate limiting tests
npx tsx src/__tests__/rate-limiting.test.ts

# CORS tests
npx tsx src/__tests__/cors.test.ts

# Security tests
npx tsx src/__tests__/security.test.ts

# Integration tests
npx tsx src/__tests__/integration.test.ts
```

### Run All Tests

```bash
# Run complete test suite
npx tsx src/__tests__/run-all-tests.ts
```

## Test Architecture

### Simple and Direct

-   ❌ No external testing frameworks (Jest, Mocha, etc.)
-   ✅ Direct HTTP requests using native `fetch`
-   ✅ Simple assertion functions
-   ✅ Clear, readable test code

### Real Server Testing

-   ✅ Tests actual HTTP servers on different ports
-   ✅ Real network requests (not mocked)
-   ✅ Tests the complete request/response cycle
-   ✅ Validates actual middleware behavior

### Comprehensive Coverage

-   🔧 **Server Creation**: Core functionality
-   🚦 **Rate Limiting**: Request throttling
-   🌐 **CORS**: Cross-origin security
-   🔒 **Security**: Security headers
-   🔗 **Integration**: Combined features

## Test Utilities

Each test file includes common utilities:

```typescript
// Simple assertion function
function assert(condition: boolean, message: string);

// HTTP request helper
async function makeRequest(url: string, options?: any);

// Sleep utility for timing tests
async function sleep(ms: number);
```

## Test Ports

Tests use different ports to avoid conflicts:

-   `8090-8092`: Rate limiting tests
-   `8093-8096`: CORS tests
-   `8097-8098`: Server creation tests
-   `8099-8103`: Security tests
-   `8104-8107`: Integration tests

## Expected Output

### Successful Test Run

```
🧪 Starting XyPrissSecurity Rate Limiting Tests...

🔬 Test 1: Basic Rate Limiting
✅ First request should succeed
✅ Second request should succeed
✅ Third request should succeed
✅ Fourth request should be rate limited (429)

🎉 All Rate Limiting Tests Passed!
```

### Test Suite Summary

```
📊 TEST SUITE SUMMARY
==================================================
Total Tests: 5
✅ Passed: 5
❌ Failed: 0
⏱️  Total Duration: 12543ms
📈 Success Rate: 100%

🎉 ALL TESTS PASSED! XyPrissSecurity is working correctly!
```

## Adding New Tests

To add new test functionality:

1. **Create a new test file** following the naming pattern: `feature-name.test.ts`
2. **Use the same test utilities** for consistency
3. **Add the file to `run-all-tests.ts`** in the `testFiles` array
4. **Use unique port numbers** to avoid conflicts
5. **Follow the same structure**: test functions + main runner

## Test Philosophy

These tests are designed to:

-   ✅ **Stress test the actual library** (not replace it with mocks)
-   ✅ **Detect and prevent bugs** in real usage scenarios
-   ✅ **Validate all major functionalities** comprehensively
-   ✅ **Provide clear feedback** on what's working/broken
-   ✅ **Be maintainable and readable** for future development

The goal is to ensure XyPrissSecurity works correctly in production environments by testing it as close to real-world usage as possible.
